HOW MANY SUPERHEROES?

This is a data visualisation project built with Flask framework in which you can meet with all DC and Marvell superheroes characters and know how many of them are good, bad, blonde or even bald. This site is a radiography of the superheroes community so letâ€™s have a look and learn more about your favourites superheroes. 

How it works?

After the little introduction, you can obtain data information about superheroes depending of your selected criteria based on the Comic Serie, Gender, Eyes or Hair. If we want to know how many comic characters are genderless and with dark eyes, we just need to set that criteria in the selecting menu. Otherwise, we will access to the data of al comic universe. 

We will know how many superheroes match with our criteria, if they belongs to the society or the dark side, if citizens know their identity or they live under a anonymous mask, and most important to feel safe or not, if they are dead or alive. 

Development process

They very first task of this project was dealing with a good database. It included a dataset research process. Once I got my database, I cleaned the inner data in order to make it presentable in the chart (filling some gaps, changing name values or categorising elements. I imported the clean dataset to MongoDB and after created a flask project, the dataset was imported as well into the project. Working with graphs libraries such as D3, DC and Crossfilter made the rest of the project. Playing with all this libraries I managed to created all graphs and inject some style to it. The last actions was inject a comic style to the presentation thank to the inspiration of all comic I read when I was kid.
